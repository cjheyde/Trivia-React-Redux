# Tivia Game - React-Redux 

This Project created a game of questions and answers based on Trivia game.

This is a front-end Project, part of [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) school requirements to move on in the studies.

<strong> It was develped by following group members:</strong>  
- [Elaine Costa](https://github.com/ElaineCostadev)
- [Paulo Bruno Machado Dias](https://github.com/devpbdias)
- [Natã Abrahão Rodrigues](https://github.com/naaharo)
- [Carla Heyde](https://github.com/cjheyde)
- and we had an important contribution with our clock from the classmate [Rodrigo Takashi Condo](https://github.com/R-Takashi), thanks, Takashi! 🙏

<strong>First commit:</strong> on May 24, 2022.

<strong>Here we had to exercise:</strong> React.js, Redux, CSS, React Testing Library, Cypress usage and Trello.

It was the best coding group I have ever had so far! We had complementary skills! Elaine was a master in testing, Paulo was the CSS person, and Natã was the one that could not sleep before solving the most complicated logic issues! I used my leadership experience and code my best to contribuite as much as I could! </br>
This was the chance to learn how to open branches to code simultaneously, how to review codes, and how to merge them. </br>
We had daily meetings, decided on who should code what, and sometimes coded in pairs or even all four togehter!
To have a better overview of the parts that needed coding and how to connect them, we used [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).
